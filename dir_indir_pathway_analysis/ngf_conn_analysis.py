#ngf connectivity analysis of different types

#imports

#load type1 and type 2 from morphological seperation

#get inputs and outputs from them seperately and plot differences
#get input once for all celltypes -> similar to ct conn

#either here or in seperate analysis plot differences to specific compartments

#get input to and from different MSN populations -> load ids there
#also look at specific compartments

#also make similar analysis for ngf_msn_gpe loop with both types
