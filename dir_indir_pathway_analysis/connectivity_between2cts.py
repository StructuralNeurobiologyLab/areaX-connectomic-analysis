#write analysis to compare connectivity of two celltypes
# compare amount of synapses, average synapse area, average amount of synapses from one cell to another, average size of synapses from one cell to another
#also compare percentage onto spine vs shaft from axo_dendritic synapses
#amount and average size of soma synapses, percentage of soma synapses from totl
