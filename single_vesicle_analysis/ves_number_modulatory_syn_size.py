#analyses to compare small and large synapses and if there are more or less vesicles in vicinity
#small: lowest quartile of mesh area
#large: highest quartile of mesh area
#add option to use only non-synaptic vesicles
#independent of close or far from membrane

#step 1: get suitable cell ids

#step 2: get all vesicle coordinates from these cells

#step 3: get all suitable synapses
#add option to select only spine or only shaft ones
#split synapses into small and large

#step 4: for each synapse get all vesicles in 5 µm radius
# then get distance of each vesicle to synapse (or do both of these together)
#save up to 5 µm radius
#make distance bins
